<p><a href="http://progrium.com/">Jeff Lindsay</a> is a systems thinking hacker-philosopher. He builds, he explores, and is apparently “wired differently.” Obsessed with esoteric knowledge, he applies modern technology driven by an eclectic model of the bigger picture. He’s heavily involved in hacker culture, startup culture, web technologies and the indie game scene. With dozens of new and ongoing projects, his motto is &#8220;always be shipping.&#8221;</p>
<p>While freelancing in 2005, Jeff met David Weekly, a local hacker-entrepreneur that later founded <a href="http://pbworks.com/">PBworks</a>. Together they started a free and open monthly event called <a href="http://shdh.org/">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>, “a party for hackers and thinkers.” It quickly gained the attention of the Silicon Valley digerati and inspired other events such as <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day">Yahoo! Hack Day</a>, as well as a network of SHDH-modeled events in countries around the world. The original SHDH event has been featured in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomicles/562325979/">San Jose Mercury News</a>, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/10/02/NSJM138575.DTL">SFGate</a>, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2300-1007_3-6202575-1.html">CNET News.com</a>, and courted by tech giants such as Google and Sun.</p>
<p>After years of hobby game development, Jeff met freeware game developer <a href="http://www.derekyu.com/">Derek Yu</a> in 2005 and helped him run and develop a blog called <a href="http://tigsource.com/">TIGSource</a>. The Independent Game Source has grown into a major community that helped bring about what is now called the indie game scene, the source of hits such as <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">World of Goo</a>, <a href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid</a>, and <a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a>. The TIGSource community has become part of a loose network of indie game developers, overlapping with many involved in the <a href="http://www.igf.com/">IGF</a> and <a href="http://gdconf.com/">GDC</a>. TIGSource has been championed by many in the game industry including <a href="http://www.1up.com/">1UP</a>, <a href="http://kotaku.com/">Kotaku</a>, and <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, Jeff started <a href="http://cvsdude.com/devjavu.html">DevjaVu</a>, a hosted Trac and SVN service. After 3 years of operating, he closed it down and handed the remaining customers to <a href="http://cvsdude.com/">CVSDude</a>, which Jeff is now an adviser for.</p>
<p>During the early months of DevjaVu, Jeff wrote about a pattern in web architecture he started to describe as <a href="http://webhooks.org/">webhooks</a>. Jeff has since presented about webhooks at SuperHappyDevHouse, Mashup Camp, Conference, Glue Conference, SXSW, and for Google and Pivotal Labs tech talks. Jeff’s work has led to the adoption of webhooks by Google, GitHub, PBworks, SocialText and many others. In 2009, the pattern was used in a protocol called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a>, used to make RSS and Atom feeds real-time. Jeff is a contributor to PubSubHubbub, which has been deployed by Google, Six Apart, FriendFeed and others. Jeff has also developed many tools and open source software to support a webhooks ecosystem, including <a href="http://www.postbin.org/">PostBin</a> and <a href="http://www.scriptlets.org/">Scriptlets</a>.</p>
<p>The success of SuperHappyDevHouse led to the formation of <a href="http://hackerdojo.com/">Hacker Dojo</a>, a non-profit community center for technologists. Jeff co-founded Hacker Dojo in 2009 with SuperHappyDevHouse co-founder David Weekly and a group of passionate friends from the community, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein">Lee Felsenstein</a>, moderator of the 1970&#8242;s computer hobbyist group Homebrew Computer Club. In just three months of operating with over 100 paying members and hundreds of visitors for events and coworking, Hacker Dojo achieved immediate success. Hacker Dojo made headlines on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/progrium/4017351989/">front page of the Mercury News</a> and garnered a letter of congratulations from the City of Mountain View.</p>
<p>Over the years, Jeff has worked with various startups as a software developer and/or product designer, including <a href="http://www.commerce.net/">CommerceNet</a>, <a href="http://typeroom.com/">TypeRoom</a>, <a href="http://usable.com/">Usable Security</a>, <a href="http://collabrx.com/">CollabRx</a>, and <a href="http://allthat.com/">AllTh.at</a>. He was recently contracted by NASA Ames and fell into the team that became the <a href="http://nebula.nasa.gov/">NASA Nebula</a> / <a href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> project, but has since left to build new products for <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>.</p>
